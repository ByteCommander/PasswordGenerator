# Password Generator

Simple but flexible password generator.

---

###Features:

#####Password generation:

- It allows you to specify the character set:
  - by enabling/disabling character classes:
    - uppercase ASCII letters `A-Z`
    - lowercase ASCII letters `a-z`
    - digits `0-9`
    - punctuation ```!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~```
    - space ` `
  - by adding custom characters
  - by blacklisting custom characters
- It allows you to specify any desired length of the password.
- It allows you to limit the maximum allowed number of occurrences of the same character, but still takes care that the password length can be reached.

#####Usage

- ######Interactive mode:

    Run the script without any arguments and you get to the interactive mode which looks like this example:

    ```
    $ ./pwgen.py
    ***** Password Generator - © 2016 ByteCommander *****

    The default character set to generate passwords is this (not including the arrows):
    → !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~←
    Do you want to change the character set? (y/N) y
    Do you want to allow uppercase letters 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'? (Y/n) y
    Do you want to allow lowercase letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'? (Y/n) y
    Do you want to allow digits '0123456789'? (Y/n) y
    Do you want to allow punctuation '!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~'? (Y/n) n
    Do you want to allow space ' '? (Y/n) n
    Please enter additional characters you want to allow (if any): -_
    Please enter characters you want to blacklist (if any): Xx0
    The default password length is 12 characters.
    Enter your desired length or leave it blank to use the default: 20
    By default, there is no limit how often a character may appear in the password.
    Enter your desired maximum duplicate character limit or leave it blank to use the default.
    A value of 0 means no limit: 1
    And your new password is:
    +----------------------+
    | jJ-USofDig7m3eO2vREd |
    +----------------------+
    Generate another password with the same settings? (Y/n)
    And your new password is:
    +----------------------+
    | VZCbKuQFIGHjqSBdgN9M |
    +----------------------+
    Generate another password with the same settings? (Y/n) n
    Thank you for using this password generator. Have a nice day!
    ```

- ######Command-line mode:

    Run the script with the command-line arguments described in its help (type `pwgen.py --help` or `pwgen.py -h` or see the block below) and you use it in command-line mode. This is useful to embed this tool into your own scripts, create your personal shortcuts for it or quickly launch it with a specific configuration.
